### AR Towerdefense with gesture control - Protoype
AR Towerdefense game we developed as a project in class.
We use OpenCV for visualisation and pose calculation.
To detect the gestures we use Google MediaPipe for hand segmentation and then use the detected keypoints to evaluate for different gestures.
